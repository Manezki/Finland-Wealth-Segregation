    "## Introduction\n",
    "Statistics Finland publishes data about the statistics of different postal regions. Our project works aims to use this data, to compare different regions of Finland to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Postal service in Finland has a nation wide coverage and postal codes are being used to ease the distribution of mail. Small areas have been assigned their own postal code, and using this postal code, one is able to lookup the location of the corresponding region. One design in the assignment of the postal codes, is that areas that can be seen to belong to distinguishable region, have postal code starting with same combination of numbers (e.g. 00 start for Helsinki) - also if postal codes (number) are close to each others, then one can assume that also the physical areas are close to each others (land area).
